Intergroup Conflict Theories

In the continuing attempt to better understand intergroup prejudice, specifically ethnocentrism, social psychologists proposed Realistic Group Conflict Theory1 (RCT) and Social Identity Theory2 (SIT). RCT concludes that intergroup conflict is caused by conflict over real group interests. The theory has considerable empirical support, and there is no shortage of examples of groups competing over scarce resources, including power, wealth, and prestige. SIT, in contrast, concludes that group conflict or competition can be caused merely by the awareness of different groups, and prestige is the output of social comparison rather than a scarce resource to compete over.

Groups may be distinguished by ethnicity, race, sex, language, religion, socio-economic class, profession, or any number of other discriminants, and they are subject to the behaviors described in the previous chapter. Both RCT and SIT study arbitrary groups by randomly assigning individuals to Team A and Team B, thus minimizing the effects of other distinctions.

According to RCT, group interests in obtaining scarce resources promote intergroup competition. Intergroup competition enhances group morale, cohesion, and cooperation, and it heightens identification within the group. Competition can lead to overt social conflict. But goals shared by groups may promote intergroup cooperation.

From RCT, “opposing claims to scarce resources—such as power, prestige, or wealth—generate ethnocentrism and antagonism between groups.”3 From SIT, “The evidence suggests, however, that where social-structural differences in the distribution of resources have been institutionalized, legitimized, and justified through a consensually accepted status system (or a least a status system that is sufficiently firm and pervasive to prevent the creation of cognitive alternatives to it), the result has been less and not more ethnocentrism in the different status groups.”4 We now focus on social identity theory.

SOCIAL IDENTITY

Social Identity Theory introduces the notion of the ingroup (us) and outgroup (them) and goes on to say that there is a tendency for ingroup members to have more favorable views of their ingroup over the outgroup—ingroup favoritism or ingroup bias. The “mere awareness of the presence of an out-group is sufficient to provoke intergroup competitive or discriminatory response on the part of the in-group.” Once acknowledged, the possibility exists for conflict, competition, or discrimination. A designation more pointed than ingroup and outgroup is between a dominant group and subordinate groups, respectively thought to be superior or inferior in status—status or prestige being the outcome of intergroup

comparison. “The laboratory analog of real-world ethnocentrism is ingroup bias—that is, the tendency to favor the in-group in evaluations and behavior.” 5 
	SIT proposes a continuum with poles labeled purely interpersonal behavior and purely intergroup behavior while acknowledging that both extremes are unlikely in the real world. Where individuals’ behavior lies on the continuum depends on the situation and the strength of identification with their ingroup. The more intense the conflict, the stronger the identification and the greater likelihood that an individual will behave more as a group member and less as an individual.

Individuals are motivated to feel good about themselves, that is, to maintain or enhance their self-esteem. That can be obtained through individual accomplishment or through identification with an elevated social group. Not just feeling good but seeking a positive distinction from others. An important component of an individual’s personal identity is his or her social identity. SIT asserts that social identity is the outcome of three distinct processes executed in series: 
	social categorization, 
	social identification, and 
	social comparison.

Social Categorization. Human beings have a natural tendency to group things. There is an immense diversity of tables and chairs, but lumping them together allows us to easily think about, speak about, and even use them. We do the same with people: White Anglo-Saxon Protestant males, people of color, doctors, lawyers, trade unionists, for example. We make sweeping generalizations about them, and in the extreme we erect and apply stereotypes. Social categorization will likely produce a large number of overlapping categories, the number limited only by what is useful to the individual. A group is a social category. Categorization systemizes the social world and provides a system of orientation for self-reference, one’s place in society.

Social Identification. Having ordered people into groups, individuals then identify themselves as belonging to one or more groups. Self-evaluation is conducted through social identity. As members of a group, individuals adopt salient aspects of that group’s behavior, including an understanding of normative behavior. For example, professionals, like doctors and lawyers, have explicit codes of conduct. Violating the professional ethic may cause suspension or removal from the profession. Adhering to the professional ethic bolsters self-esteem and peer respect. In addition to parental and social pressures, group membership can impose one more set of restraints on instinctive behavior.

Social Comparison. Armed with group categorization and identification with one or more groups, individuals then turn to intergroup social comparison, that is, comparing their ingroup with relevant outgroups seeking positive aspects of the ingroup or seeking negative aspects of an outgroup enhances one’s self-image. An individual strives to achieve and maintain positive social identity, and a positive social identity is largely based on favorable intergroup comparison. We are motivated to maintain our self-esteem and will seek positive

comparison with other groups. Groups become rivals and comparison leads to competition or even conflict.

Once a social categorization is constructed, members tend to exaggerate the differences between the groups and tend to exaggerate the similarities of individuals in a group. Individuals tend to see outgroup members as interchangeable rather than as unique individuals. “[T]he mere awareness of the presence of an out-group is sufficient to provoke intergroup competitive or discriminatory response on the part of the in-group.”6

Social Hierarchy. Consistent with previous analysis, a group status hierarchy is assumed ever-present. Comparison produces a hierarchical ordering of group status. “The aim of differentiation is to maintain or achieve superiority over an out-group on some dimensions.”7 Social status is defined as “a ranking or hierarchy of perceived prestige,” that reflects relative position on some evaluative dimension.8

SOCIAL CHANGE

“Subordinate groups often seem to internalize a wider social evaluation of themselves as ‘inferior’ or ‘second class’ producing a consensual inferiority that is stabilizing.9 But when the system is clearly stratified and perceived as unjust, it is “impossible or very difficult for individuals, as individuals, to invest themselves of an unsatisfactory, underprivileged, or stigmatized group membership.”10 
	Social identity theory asks four questions. Is the hierarchical system permeable? Is the system stable? Is the system legitimate? Which value dimensions serve for intergroup comparison and ranking in the social hierarchy? Answers to these questions lead to three strategies for improving one’s social identity:

	individual mobility,

	social competition, and

	social creativity.

Individual Mobility. If the hierarchy is perceived to be stable and permeable, then individual mobility, or upward mobility, offers the individual a possible path up the social ladder. A number of myths support the belief in upward mobility: the “self-made man,” “pulling oneself up by the boot straps,” and the rags to riches Horatio Algiers stories.

The individual mobility belief system rests on the perception that the system is a meritocracy. The individual is not bound by race, sex, religion, or economic situation, for example; the individual is limited only by talent and effort. The widespread belief in individual mobility both rests on the perception of system stability and further promotes system stability. There is no need for social change and the dimensions for intergroup comparison need not be challenged.

Adherents to the individual mobility belief system accept the system as just or just enough. But others believe that individual mobility is inadequate and that the social system must be changed before it can be accepted as just and legitimate. For those, social competition and social creativity offer strategies for social change. Individual mobility requires individuals to break the group bond and leave their former peers behind; social change, however, preserves individuals’ identification with their ingroup.

Social Competition. If the system’s intergroup boundaries are perceived to be relatively impermeable and the system potentially unstable (amenable to change), then a social competition strategy requires group members to coalesce in an effort for their group to achieve better outcomes in terms of access to scarce resources.

Social Creativity. If the system is perceived to be relatively impermeable and the system reasonably stable (resistant to change), then social creativity offers three methods of improving a group’s positive self-image.

	Comparing the ingroup to the outgroup on some new dimension. The subordinate group 	must legitimize the new dimensional comparison and can expect the dominant group to 	oppose.

	Changing the values assigned to the attributes of the group, so that comparisons which 	were previously negative are now perceived as positive. “Black is beautiful” and “Black 	Lives Matter” are examples. Again, the dominant group will likely oppose.

to the dominant group, a subordinate immigrant group might compare itself to another subordinate immigrant group.

Threats to Status. Discrimination is one method of resistance to change. The status security of individuals and groups depends on the perceived legitimacy of the status quo system. But when the legitimacy of the social system is challenged, stability may be undermined, and those challenges will likely be seen as threats by some. “[W]hen the dominant group or sections of it perceive their superiority to be legitimate, they will likely react in an intensely discriminatory fashion to any attempt by the subordinate group to change the intergroup situation.”12

An unequal distribution of objective resources promotes antagonism between dominant and subordinate groups, provided that the latter group rejects its previously accepted and consensually negative self-image, and with it the status quo, and starts working toward the development of a positive group identity. The dominant group may react to these developments either by doing everything possible to maintain and justify the status quo or by attempting to find and create new differentiations in its own favor, or both.13
